What Does Type Inference Mean?

Type inference is the automatic deduction of the data types of specific expressions 
in a programming language, usually done at compile time. It involves analyzing a 
program and then inferring the different types of some or all expressions in that 
program so that the programmer does not need to explicitly input and define data 
types every time variables are used in the program.


Techopedia Explains Type Inference
Type inference is often a compiler feature of functional programming languages rather
 than of object-oriented ones. The compiler or interpreter needs only minimal 
 information as well as context in order to figure out what the data type of a 
 variable or expression is.

The inference algorithm tries to determine the argument types as well as the return
 value type and then it tries to find the most specific data type that works with all
 of the arguments. As a basic example, consider the function Foo(a,b) = x + y; the 
 compiler knows that the "+" operator takes two integers and also returns an integer,
 so now the compiler or interpreter can infer that Foo also has the type integer.
