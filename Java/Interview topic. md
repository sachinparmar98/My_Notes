[Java]Interview List
Let's just put the concepts together and put them in your head.
If you intend to have a question that is not in the question itself, I added it.
Instead of a complete explanation, focus on interview responses, and additional responses write a good keyword.

What's the Garvey collection?
Background & Question Intent


Understanding the structure of JVM, especially the Heap Area
답변


The object used in the JVM where Java is running, namely the ability to manage objects in the Heap area.
During this process, stop the world occurs, and to make this series process efficient, you need to change the furniture collector or adjust the detailed value.
Keyword & Tail Question


Garbage collection process, understanding of the type of garbage collector
What's the difference between StringBuilder and StringBuffers?
Background & Question Intent


mutation, immutation
Understand performance issues arising from the operation of String, an immutable object
String
immutation
Reduced performance due to repetitive creation of immutable objects in the process of calculating string strings.
답변


같은점
mutation
Support for api such as append()
차이점
StringBuilder does not support synchronization, so it speeds faster in single threads.
StringBuffer supports synchronization in multi-thread environments, but this implementation should question the logic.
Keyword & Tail Question


Operate String in Practice
What is the memory area in Java?
Background & Question Intent


Understanding JVM Structure
답변


It is divided into methods, hip, stack, pc registers, and native areas.
Method areas are created when a class is loaded and are primarily stored for static variables.
The hip area is allocated on runtime and mostly objects are stored.
The stack area is allocated when compiling and the regional variable is saved when calling the method.
The pc registry knows the address of the following command as the area created each time a thread is created.
A native area is an area for code written in a non-Java language.
Hips and stacks dynamically share the same memory space, and OOMs can occur if overused.
The hip area is sorted through the GC.
Keyword & Tail Question


Method Area (Class Area)
It is created when a class is loaded.
Class, variable, method information
static variable
Constant pool - Character constant, type, field, object reference saved
Stack Area
Compilation is assigned on time.
When a method is called, an individual stack is created and disconnected when terminated.
Area where temporary values, such as regional variables, are generated
It has the address value of the object that is generated in the Heap area.
Heap Area
Runtime is assigned.
The area where objects and arrangements are stored to be created with new keywords
It will not be deleted immediately if there is no reference variable. -> Deleted via GC.

What's the difference between overloading and over-loading?
Background & Question Intent


답변


Overloading
No return type relationship, same method name, different parameters (material type or order)
Overriding
Return type, method name, and parameter are all the same.
To redefine the methods inherited from the parent class.
Keyword & Tail Question


Overloading is useful when multiple creators are needed.
Interface is one of the ways to lower the bondage, and overriding is actively used in this process.
What's the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
Background & Question Intent


답변


abstract class Abstract class
Supports single inheritance.
You can have variables.
There must be one or more abstract methods.
Implement abstract methods through inheritance in the children's class. (extends)
You can inherit implemented methods that are not abstract methods.
Interface
Supports multiple inheritance.
Cannot have a variable. Constant is possible.
All methods exist only as declarations.
Implementation class overriding all declared methods.
Keyword & Tail Question


The higher the java version, the more the functionality of abstract is absorbed by the interface.
java 8: default method available in interface
java 9: private method available in interface
Generic?
Make the type used in the class to be set outside the class
The class declared as a generic can be used to create the type I want.
<Only reference types (classes, interfaces, arrangements) are available (wrapper classes must be used to use basic data types)
참고
Autoboxing, Unboxing
Access controller? (Access Modifier)
Background & Question Intent


답변


public: All access permitted
protected: Inherited class or similar package but allowed access
default: Default limit. Inside your class or like package but allowed access
private: External access is not possible. Only within the same class.
Keyword & Tail Question


참고
Normally, default is not used well, preferring explicit expressions.
Java Compilation Process
Background & Question Intent


Question close to CS
답변


The compiler converted: Source Code -> Java Byte Code(.class)
JVM Convert: Bytecode -> Machine
Run Applications with Interpreter
Keyword & Tail Question


JIT Compiler
